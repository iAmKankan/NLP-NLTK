# Natural Language Processing
* **Natural language processing (NLP)**: It is the branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. 
* NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics, in its pursuit to fill the gap between human communication and computer understanding.
* For Working with NLP we can use two types of approaches **1. Word level**, **2. Character level**.

### Libraries we used for NLP
* We usually use these libraries in NLP, which are:
  * NLTK (Natural language Tool kit)
  * TextBlob
  * CoreNLP
  * Polyglot
  * Gensim
  * SpaCy
  * Scikit-learn
  * And the new one is **Megatron library** launched recently.


### Tokenization
* Tokenization is the task of chopping it up into pieces, called tokens, perhaps at the same time throwing away certain characters, such as punctuation.  Consider how the program might break up the sentences into words.

## spaCy:
* This is completely optimized and highly accurate library widely used in deep learning.
