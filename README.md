# Natural Language Processing
* **Natural language processing (NLP)**: It is the branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. 
* NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics, in its pursuit to fill the gap between human communication and computer understanding.
* For Working with NLP we can use two types of approaches **1. Word level**, **2. Character level**.

### Libraries we used for NLP
* We usually use these libraries in NLP, which are:
  * NLTK (Natural language Tool kit)
  * TextBlob
  * CoreNLP
  * Polyglot
  * Gensim
  * SpaCy
  * Scikit-learn
  * And the new one is **Megatron library** launched recently.


### Tokenization
* Tokenisation is the act of breaking a sequence of strings into pieces such as words, keywords, phrases, symbols and other elements called tokens. 
* Tokens can be individual words, phrases or even whole sentences. 
* In the process of tokenisation, some characters like punctuation marks are discarded.

### Stemming?
* **Stemming**: It is the process of reducing inflexions in words to their root forms such as mapping a group of words to the same stem even if stem itself is not a valid word in the Language.

|    | Word        | StemWord |
|----|-------------|----------|
| 0  | Connect     | Connect  |
| 1  | Connections | Connect  |
| 2  | Connection  | Connect  |
| 3  | Connects    | Connect  |
| 04 | Connected   | Connect  |


## spaCy:
* This is completely optimized and highly accurate library widely used in deep learning.
