# Natural Language Processing

* For Working with NLP we can use two types of approaches 1. Word level, 2. Character level.
* [When we apply neural networks to Natural Language Processing (NLP), we must decide if you want to operate at the word or character level. Up to this point, we've worked primarily at the character level, which was the case for the Treasure Island text pirate story generator that we previously saw. Likewise, we used word-level NLP for the image caption generator. In this module, the focus will be primarily on word-level NLP. Notably, we will examine some of the NLP tools that we can be used to process words before we send them to a neural network. There are two prevalent NLP libraries for Python:]

### Tokenization
* Tokenization is the task of chopping it up into pieces, called tokens, perhaps at the same time throwing away certain characters, such as punctuation.  Consider how the program might break up the sentences into words.

## spaCy:
* This is completely optimized and highly accurate library widely used in deep learning.
