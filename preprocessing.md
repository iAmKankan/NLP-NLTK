## Preprocessing
* Preprocessing is one of the major steps when we are dealing with any kind of text model.
*  During this stage, we have to look at the distribution of our data, what techniques are needed and how deep we should clean.
* This step never has a one-hot rule, and totally depends on the problem statement.
*  Few mandatory preprocessing are: converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, removing stop words and lemmatization/stemming.
