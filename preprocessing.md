* Preprocessing is one of the major steps when we are dealing with any kind of text model.
*  During this stage, we have to look at the distribution of our data, what techniques are needed and how deep we should clean.
* This step never has a one-hot rule, and totally depends on the problem statement.
*  Few mandatory preprocessing are: converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, removing stop words and lemmatization/stemming. 
* Preprocessing Steps
   *  Padding Sequences
   *  Convert text to lowercase
   *  Remove Numbers Remove Punctuation
   *  Remove english stop words
   *  Remove own stop words (if required)
   *  Strip whitespace
   *  Stemming and Lemmatization
   *  Remove Sparse terms
   *  Tokenization
   *  Find Bigrams, Trigrams etc.
