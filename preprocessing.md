## Preprocessing
Preprocessing is one of the major steps when we are dealing with any kind of text model. During this stage, we have to look at the distribution of our data, what techniques are needed and how deep we should clean.
This step never has a one-hot rule, and totally depends on the problem statement. Few mandatory preprocessing are: converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, removing stop words and lemmatization/stemming. In our problem statement, it seems like the basic preprocessing steps will be sufficient.
